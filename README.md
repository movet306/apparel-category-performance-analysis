# Apparel Category Performance Analysis (Portfolio Project)

This project simulates an end-to-end business case focused on analyzing the performance of denim products over a 26-week period. It demonstrates key business analyst skills including:

- Exploratory data analysis (Excel)
- Interactive visualizations (Power BI)
- Executive summary (PDF report)
  ## 🧠Notes

This project originally relied on Excel-based calculations.  
Due to GitHub’s 25MB file size limit, the Excel file is hosted on Google Drive instead:  
➡️ [Open Excel (Google Sheets format)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygTBl7NrWGQefUU4ZadRP-YAAXa5Du4Q/edit?usp=sharing)

**Important:**  
Some formulas (e.g., `SUMPRODUCT`, `SORT`, `UNIQUE`) may not function identically in Google Sheets due to compatibility differences.
